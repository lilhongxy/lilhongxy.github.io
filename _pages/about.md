Hi, I'm Xiangyu Hong, a third-year undergraduate majoring in Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. 

My research interests focus on understanding the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) and enhancing the interpretability of their behaviors. I aim to leverage this analysis to improve LLM performance and reliability. Some of the key questions I want to explore include:

- How do contextual knowledge and parameter-encoded knowledge interact, especially in cases of knowledge conflict or complementarity?
- How can we deepen our understanding of model representations to detect hallucinations, pinpoint key nodes in information processing, and effectively extract and apply task-specific representations?
